	<h1>More information about me</h1>
	<p>>I will include more information about me, nowadays in Korea, it is fall season as in Canada. I tend to take pictures of sky ! It is so beautiful and clear but It would be a pity to I cannot travel other area or countries because of the pandamic. Actually, I loove to go camping and gathered around the campfire in there. There is a exact small like firewood smell that I like. I hope it will get better soon:) and everyone be safe !
