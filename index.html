After I became a homebody nowadays, I would like to do my bobbies in the house such as watching the Netflex, reading a book, cooking and watching Youtube videos.</h2>

		<p> However, there are something that I do not like such as an insect, it is really stressful whether small or big. and I am weak to cold weather. It made me shrink back in cold that is why sometimes I sank into a state of torpor in winter. </p>
